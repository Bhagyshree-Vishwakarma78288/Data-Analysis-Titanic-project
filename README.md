# Data-Analysis-Titanic-project
 data analysis project using VS Code, we aimed to predict Titanic passenger survival. We utilized the Pandas library for data manipulation and performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key patterns. Implementing a logistic regression model, we achieved an accuracy of 81%, showcasing our skills in data analysis and machine learning.

 "In this project, we addressed the challenge of predicting passenger survival on the Titanic using data analysis techniques. By leveraging various features from the dataset, we developed a predictive model that achieved an accuracy of 81%. This highlights our ability to extract meaningful insights from complex data, ultimately providing a framework for understanding key factors influencing survival outcomes."

 In this project, we learned to manipulate data using Pandas and conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights. We applied logistic regression for predictive modeling and gained experience in evaluating model performance. Overall, we enhanced our understanding of data-driven decision-making and the practical applications of machine learning.
